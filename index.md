## What is the StreamTimerApp?

The Stream Timer App is a simple timer that outputs to a text file that any stream broadcasting software (obs/slobs/etc) can read and add a customizable repeating timer on your overlay. It can optionally play a wave file when the timer is finished.!

## Why make StreamTimerApp?

I'm a streamer and mostly stream Creative Writing. The Twitch Writers Network and other writing streams have brought the concept of the "Sprint Timer" and introduced it as a way for both streamer and viewer to interact. I was directed to SNAZ but after awhile I realized it wasn't exactly what I wanted. The timers were all one-offs and I needed something that repeated. Thus the StreamTimerApp was born. It's my first C# program and it's my learning experience. 

For now the Simple Timer is done and ready to share. So enjoy!

## Instillation:

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/Lethann/StreamTimerApp/releases) and extract the files to a selected location on your computer.
2. Run the StreamTimerApp.exe file
NOTE: I'm looking to get an actual installer made.
