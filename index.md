## What is the StreamTimerApp?

The Stream Timer App is a simple timer that outputs to a text file that any stream broadcasting software (obs/slobs/etc) can read and add a customizable repeating timer on your overlay. It can optionally play a wave file when the timer is finished.!

## Why make StreamTimerApp?

I'm a streamer and mostly stream Creative Writing. The Twitch Writers Network and other writing streams have brought the concept of the "Sprint Timer" and introduced it as a way for both streamer and viewer to interact. I was directed to SNAZ but after awhile I realized it wasn't exactly what I wanted. The timers were all one-offs and I needed something that repeated. Thus the StreamTimerApp was born. It's my first C# program and it's my learning experience. 

For now the Simple Timer is done and ready to share. So enjoy!

## Instillation:

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/Lethann/StreamTimerApp/releases) and extract the files to a selected location on your computer.
2. Run the StreamTimerApp.exe file
NOTE: I'm looking to get an actual installer made.

## Simple Timer Instructions:

1. Click "Browse" button and select or create your txt file.
2. Enter the number of Minutes you want the timer to last.
3. Type in any label or message you want displayed with your timer.
4. OPTIONAL: Choose a short WAV file to play at the end of the timer.

Using your streaming software, create a Text Source and tell it to read from a file, using the text file from step 1.
